My name is Ian Maleney. I’m a writer, editor and web developer living in Dublin, Ireland. 

My writing has appeared in The Irish Times, The Sunday Times, The Wire, Resident Advisor, The Quietus, Gorse, and The Millions. I help out at the [Stinging Fly](https://stingingfly.org), and I’m the founder and editor of [Fallow Media](https://fallowmedia.com). I cover the arts, politics and technology. I keep an incomplete and rarely up-to-date list of published work [here](/writing/).

I also work as a web developer with select artistic organisations and cultural institutions, such as The Stinging Fly, Paper Visual Art, Tramp Press, and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. You can find out more about that side of things over [here](/design/).
