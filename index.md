<div class="c-home-section__body c-home-section__body--single-col">

<p>I have been working as a freelance writer for the past seven years. I write about the arts, most often music and literature, as well as technology, politics, and rural affairs. My writing has appeared in many publications around the world, including <em>The Irish Times</em>, <em>The Sunday Times</em>, <em>The Wire</em>, <em>Winter Papers</em>, <em>Resident Advisor</em>, <em>The Quietus</em>, <em>Gorse</em>, and <em>The Millions</em>.</p> 

<p>I work as the online editor of Ireland’s leading literature journal, <em><a href="https://stingingfly.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Stinging Fly</a></em>, where I commission essays and reviews of contemporary literature, and produce a monthly podcast.</p> 

<p>I’m the founder and editor of <em><a href="https://fallowmedia.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fallow Media</a></em>, an experimental, reader-funded online arts publication which combines modern web technologies with longform writing and multimedia projects.</p> 

<p>I also work as a web developer with select artistic organisations and cultural institutions, such as <em>The Stinging Fly</em>, <em>Paper Visual Art</em>, <em>Tramp Press</em>, and the <em>Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland</em>.</p> 

<p>I’m one of the team at <em><a href="http://grayscale.ie/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grayscale</a></em>, where I help to curate innovative audio/visual events in unusual, interesting spaces around Dublin.</p>

<p>If you’d like to talk about working with me on a project, <a href="mailto:imaleney@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">just get in touch</a>.</p>
