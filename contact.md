My name is Ian Maleney. I’m a writer and web developer from Ireland. 

My writing has appeared in The Irish Times, The Sunday Times, The Wire, Resident Advisor, The Quietus, Gorse, and The Millions. I help to edit the Stinging Fly's website, and I’m the founder and editor of [Fallow Media](https://fallowmedia.com). I cover the arts, politics and technology. I keep an incomplete list of published work [here](/writing/).

I also work as a web developer with select artistic organisations and cultural institutions, such as The Stinging Fly, Paper Visual Art, and Tramp Press. You can find out more about that side of things over [here](/design/).
