I work with arts organisations and cultural institutions to develop and improve their online presence. Over the last twelve months or so, I've been lucky to be involved in this capacity with great organisations like The Stinging Fly, Tramp Press, Paper Visual Art, Response To A Request, and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. I enjoy working on all elements of a web project, from data management and information architecture through to design, copy-writing and digital strategy. I'm comfortable working alone or with a team, on a project of any size. 

I'm also responsible for [Fallow Media](https://fallowmedia.com), which is an ongoing experiment in digital literature, music and design. It's a playground really – a place where long-form, interdisciplinary editorial content, high quality design, and DIY ethics come together to form something unique. I'm very proud to have published some of Ireland's finest young writers there, in ways that couldn't have been achieved anywhere else. I can't fully explain it, so maybe go have a look around.

I will soon have some case studies and project overviews here, but if you'd like to chat about a web-based project – big or small – drop me a line at [imaleney@gmail.com](mailto:imaleney@gmail.com). I'm currently looking to book in projects from September-December 2017.
