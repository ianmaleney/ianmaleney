I work with arts organisations and cultural institutions to develop and improve their online presence. I've been lucky to be involved in this capacity with great organisations like The Stinging Fly, Tramp Press, Paper Visual Art and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. I love to work on all elements of a web project, from data management and information architecture through to design, copy-writing and digital strategy. I'm comfortable working alone or with a team, on a project of any size.

I will soon have some case studies and project overviews here, but if you'd like to chat about a web-based project – big or small – drop me a line at [imaleney@gmail.com](mailto:imaleney@gmail.com). I'm currently looking to book in projects from September-December 2017.

I'm also responsible for [Fallow Media](https://fallowmedia.com), an ongoing experiment in digital literature, music and design. It's a playground really, a place to test limits. I can't really explain it, so maybe go have a look around.
